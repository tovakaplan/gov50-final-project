## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to hate crimes in the US. In particular, I am interested in investigating the question of what causes/correlates to rises in hate crimes. Do areas with more Jewish/Black/Muslim/LGBT/other marginalized groups have higher or lower rates of hate crimes? Does this relationship hold across all minority catagories, or are there differences? Are there more hate crimes in certain seasons? More around religious holidays, elections?
