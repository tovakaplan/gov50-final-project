## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to hate crimes in the US. In particular, I am interested in investigating the question of what causes/correlates to rises in hate crimes. Do areas with more Jewish/Black/Muslim/LGBT/other marginalized groups have higher or lower rates of hate crimes? Does this relationship hold across all minority catagories, or are there differences? Are there more hate crimes in certain seasons? More around religious holidays, elections? 

## Milestone 2
FBI Hate Crime Statistics Dataset: https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads 

Research question: Does a rise in Anti-Jewish hate crimes correlate with a rise in all other hate crimes? 

Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that an increase in anti-Jewish hate crimes is positively correlated with an increase in all other hate crimes. Furthermore, I believe that I will find a strong positive correlation. This is because I think that the same underlying political and cultural currents could cause both an increase in Anti-jewish crimes and crimes against other minority groups such as African Americans, Muslims, and gay people. In addition, a rise in Anti-Jewish hate crimes could be caused by an overall increase in crime, which would also cause all other hate crimes to rise. 

Explanatory variables: Anti-Jewish Hate Crimes
The outcome variable, in this case, would be "All Other Hate Crimes" or simply "Other Hate Crimes." The goal is to assess whether changes in the levels of Anti-Jewish hate crimes are associated with changes in the levels of all other hate crimes.


Observed pattern: The observed pattern that would provide support for my hypothesis would be if I perform a correlation analysis and discover a correlation coefficient above 0. 



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
hate_crime <- read.csv("~/Downloads/hate_crime (1) 2/hate_crime/hate_crime.csv")
```


## Milestone 3

```{r}
anti_jewish_hate_crimes <- hate_crime %>%
  filter(bias_desc == "Anti-Jewish")

summary_data <- anti_jewish_hate_crimes %>%
  group_by(data_year, region_name) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

ggplot(data = summary_data, aes(x = data_year, y = count, fill = region_name, color = region_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Anti-Jewish Hate Crimes Year-to-Year by Region",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Hate Crimes") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(fill = "Region:", color = "Region:") +  
  theme_minimal() 
```
## Milestone 4

```{r}
hate_crime_subset <- hate_crime %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(bias_desc == "Anti-Jewish", "Anti-Jewish", "Other Hate Crimes")) %>%
  group_by(data_year, group) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()


hate_crime_pivot <- hate_crime_subset %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = group, values_from = count, values_fill = 0)


correlation <- cor(hate_crime_pivot[, -1], method = "pearson")[1, 2]


ggplot(hate_crime_subset, aes(x = data_year, y = count, color = group)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Trends in Anti-Jewish and Other Hate Crimes Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Hate Crimes",
       color = "Hate Crime Type") +
  theme_minimal()

cat("Correlation between Anti-Jewish and Other Hate Crimes:", correlation, "\n")
```
```{r}
correlation <- cor(hate_crime_pivot[, -1], method = "pearson")[1, 2]

cat("Correlation between Anti-Jewish and Other Hate Crimes:", correlation, "\n")
```

The correlation found between Anti-Jewish and all other hate crimes is 0.465, which indicates a moderately strong positive correlation.
